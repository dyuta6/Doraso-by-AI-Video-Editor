### Information We Collect
We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create an account, upload photos, or contact us for support. This may include:
- Account information (email, display name)
- Photos and videos you upload
- Usage data and preferences
- Communication records

### How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to:
- Provide and maintain our services

### Information Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only in the following circumstances:
- With your explicit consent
- To comply with legal obligations
- To protect our rights and safety
- With service providers who assist in our operations

### Face Data and Photos
What we collect: When you upload a photo that may contain a face, we process that image to generate a talking‑head video. We do not collect or create biometric identifiers, faceprints, face geometry, or facial recognition templates.
Purpose of use: The photo is used only to render a lip‑synced video at your request. We do not perform identification, verification, or matching of the person in the image.
Third parties and storage:
Image hosting: We temporarily host the uploaded photo on ImgBB to obtain a URL for rendering.
Rendering provider: We send the image URL and your script to D‑ID solely to generate the video.
App infrastructure: We store minimal job metadata (e.g., talk ID, image URL, selected voice, and text) in Firebase/Firestore to track processing and delivery. We do not store the raw image on our own servers.
Retention:
Photo: We do not keep a local copy. The hosted image reference (URL) is retained only as long as needed to complete the rendering and support your video history. You can request deletion at any time; when you delete your content or account, we remove our references and request/enable deletion of the hosted image.
Metadata: Job metadata is retained only as needed for service provision, billing/compliance, and troubleshooting, then deleted per our retention schedule or upon your request/account deletion.
Sharing: Face photos are not sold or shared for marketing. They are shared only with the above service providers to fulfill your request, under contractual and security safeguards.
Security: Data is transmitted over HTTPS; access is restricted; we review third‑party security practices.
Your controls: You can delete uploaded content and request deletion of hosted images and associated metadata at any time by contacting us at [your email].

### Data Retention
We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide our services and comply with legal obligations. You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time.

### Your Rights
You have the right to:
- Access your personal information

Each provider processes data solely to provide the requested service and under its own privacy policy.
Data Retention (clarification)

Job metadata (IDs, URLs, text, voice selection): Retained only as necessary for operations and then deleted per policy or on request.
